        <h2>The Monastic City</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Glendalough is the home of sone of the most important monastic sites on the east coast of Ireland. The
          'Monastic City' as it is commonly known as today, was founded by the famous St. Kevin in the 6th century. This
          area was said to have
          been developed over time since it's creation 100s of years ago.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Today the settlement consists of structural remains and the most impressive of these being the Round Tower
          which stands 30m high. The main grouping of ruined buildings can be located downstream near the tower
          itself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite the age of the site, experiencing the place in person is a treat many people of all ages will
          undoubtfully enjoy. The Round Tower itself is an iconic structure and is perfect as a backdrop for photos. If
          you come to Glendalough you cannot miss checking it out for yourself! </p>

        <h2>Hiking up the Spinc's Walk</h2>
        <br>
        <p>There are many paths and hikes a visitor could take in Glendalough; but none are quite as rewarding as the
          Spinc Mountain trail. This hike is not for the faint hearted so casual walkers beware. This trail begins with
          the hardest part of the path however, if you can climb 600 steps of stairs up the mountain pass you are in for
          a treat. The view is spectacular and the walk is slowly down hill from there.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All hikers please be aware and come prepared. The Spinc's path is excellently sign posted so chances of
          getting lost are unlikely. It is important to note however, that weather conditions can make the climb
          potentially treacherous and it is advised that you come well prepared for that days forecasted weather. The
          walk takes about 3 hours to complete for the average visitor so plan your day accordingly!</p>

        <h2>The Glendalough Mines</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Glendalough's history is as recent as it is old. The Glendalough mines were opened back in the 1790's where
          lead, zinc and silver were mined. Mining in the valley took place for well over 150 years and at the
          peak of the mining production upwards of 2,000 miners were employed at the site. This continued up until 1957
          where they were closed. Today the mines remain sealed shut and many flooded over the 60 years of inactivity.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>While the mines themselves may not be accessible to visitors of Glendalough, the Mining village ruins remain
          in the area. Rusted machinary can also be found scattered and abandoned which makes for a nice walk through
          not so distant Glendalough history. In fact this place to visit, is nearing the end of the Spinc hike.</p>

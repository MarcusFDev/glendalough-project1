## Visual Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes:

### Fonts
![Website Font example](assets/images/font-picture.webp)
- The primary font used on the website was [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=josefin+sans). This font was chosen as the main font because it gives the website a 'Celtic' aesthetic which suits a very old and history rich region in Ireland. Practically, this font is easy to read on all devices and is not as harsh on the eyes to read as other fonts with a similar theme. This font styles well as headings and large sections of text which allowed for a universal use of the font across all text on the site. This was very important as this website is designed to be accessible and attractive to all users of the site. 
- The secondary font for the website [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans) was chosen because of it's easy readability for large amounts of text. It is both playful and inviting to all users, providing a welcoming and friendly feeling which is reflective of Glendalough itself with it's wonderful nature and beauty.

### Icons
![Website Icon example](assets/images/footer-readme-image-2.webp)
- Icons used throughout the website were taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/search) icon library. They are utilized in the `<i>` tag.
- Icons are used in the Navigation Bar & Footer as well as other elements across the website such as the 404.html page. They were used to create a more visually appealing site. Appropriate use of icons was done to also visually help users navigate the webpages.

### Colors
![Website Color palette](assets/images/project1-palette-resized.webp)
- When designing the website, matching and complimenting colors needed to be used to have unified theme that suited the project. Glendalough is part of a National Park, people go there to experience nature. It is also by extension associated with Ireland's beauty. So finding colors that best reflected this was crucial. It was decided that three different shades of green would be the vibrant colors utilized.
- The darkest green on the palette, Midnight Green or #073B3A, was used as borders and to highlight structure as it stands out on the page quite well. 
- The next green that was chosen was Dartmouth Green or #0B6E4F. This Green was utilized as the Title and text headings. It stands out from the Light Gray and White Smoke colors present, but not too 'strong' by comparison to Midnight Green used for the borders. 
- The lightest green, Emerald or #21D375 was used as a highlight color for links/buttons on the webpage. It stands out for it's light and eye catching brightness, but if used too much could be considered too bright. It however keeps to the nature theme of the website and is perfect for highlights to gain the users attention. 
- The website's primary colors were chosen as shades of green so finding a suitable color to match and balance this out was required. The use of Whitesmoke or #F5F5F5 was chosen as a color that has a soft contrast to the greens prevalent on the site. It is not as harsh as standard white and was deemed more suitable. It is used quite often to contrast the greens, sometimes as font coloring. 
- Light Gray or #D3D3D3 was used as a even softer contrast to the greens. It is used as background colors for large amounts of text for ease of reading while also making the vibrant colors around it 'pop' out more to the user. 
- Finally, default Black font color was otherwise used as the main text color. It stands out from the light gray around it, directs attention to itself but not harsh with the contrast around it for the user to read.

### Gallery background
![Gallery Page background](assets/images/green-wallpaper.webp)
- When creating the Gallery page, having a background that provided color but also texture was the goal. During the Gallery's creation, testing using images as graphics to enhance the standard color palette was being worked on. Soon later it was decided that avoiding attempting to achieve this across the entire website for this project due to conscious time constraints was best. However using it here was still possible. 
- Finding the image online, it was edited using Windows photo tools until the coloring matched the style that was needed.
- Using `<background-repeat:repeat;>` on the image it created a repeating style across the back of the page which filled the spacing between the gallery images well.
